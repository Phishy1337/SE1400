        <h2>Competition Analysis</h2>

        <h3>What competitors are doing right:</h3>
        <p>Competitors like Mike Bracken have sleek designs for their architectural portfolios, which work well for
            landscapes and editorial photos.</p>

        <h3>What competitors are doing wrong:</h3>
        <p>Some competitors have confusing navigation controls and poor color choices (like the pink selection in
            navigation).</p>

        <h3>How I can do better:</h3>
        <p>I plan to replicate the basic layout and navigation while improving the font choices, photo sizing, and
            rendering details to create a more user-friendly experience.</p>
